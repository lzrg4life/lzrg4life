Hi, I'm @lzrg4life.

I am currently working remotely fulltime as a Software Developer for a small company.

My repositories here on GitHub are mostly my dabbling in things that I do not work with during my dy job.

### Skills

My skill set currently includes:
- Progressive Web Applications, Web APIs, Desktop Applications
- Python, C#, Delphi, TypeScript/JavaScript, SQL
- IIS, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, AWS S3, Docker

I also have a basic knowledge of several other languages not listed.

### Education

I double majored in Computer Science and Accounting. After college I worked as an accountant for a couple years but got bored with it and found a job leveraging my programming skills.
